 Which strategy to use when selecting revision for building.
 There can be optional or required build choosers from extensions. 
 Default will check if there's any strategies coming from extension point. If there's one and only one required build choosers, it is used automatically. In other cases, original is used.
 Original will search HEADs for different branches
